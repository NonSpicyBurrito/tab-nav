# Tab Nav

Word navigation using `Tab` key.

## Features

-   Keybinding `Tab`: navigate to next.
-   Keybinding `Shift+Tab`: navigate to previous.
-   One at a time: a list of configurable characters to tab over one at a time.
-   Blacklist and whitelist mode: control whether to enable or disable Tab Nav based on current language.
-   Command "Toggle Current Language": toggle current language in languages.
-   Command "Toggle Enabled": toggle enabled/disabled as quick escape hatch.

## Rationale

`Tab` key is historically used to insert `\t` character in order to align text. However, with the advent of code formatters, manually formatting with `Tab` is no longer necessary.

This extension provides a way to navigate between words more efficiently using `Tab` and `Shift+Tab`, instead of the default `Ctrl+Right` and `Ctrl+Left`.
